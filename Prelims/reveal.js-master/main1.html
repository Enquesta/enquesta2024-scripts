<section data-background="prelimsimage.png"><h4>Question 17</h4><p class="r-fit-text">In 1976, Mattel’s CEO Ray Wagner declined a deal to produce a toy line of action figures from the Star Wars universe, due to $750,000 license fees. This dealt a huge blow to their market share.
	In the race to design the next popular action figure, Roger Sweet, the lead designer realized that simplicity was the key to success. He ‘glued’ a ‘Big Jim’ figure into a battle action pose, added clay to its body and had plaster casts made. These three prototypes would later go on to become X, which was probably named so to attract boys to the toy line.
	X got his power by raising his sword and proclaiming, “By the power of Grayskull….” Once the transformation was complete, he would continue, “... I have the power!”.
