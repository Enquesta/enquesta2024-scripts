The aggression level was stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer and the negative value would therefore result in an integer overflow, with the value being stored as 255 and X supposedly becoming about 25 times more aggressive than the most aggressive leaders in the game giving X a tendency to use nuclear weapons.
