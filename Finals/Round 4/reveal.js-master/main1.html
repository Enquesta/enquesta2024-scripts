<section><section data-background="logoslides/logoslides.png"><h4>Question 12</h4><p class="r-fit-text">Sid Meier’s Civilization is a series of turn based strategy video games. According to popular game legend, X was the only leader in the game with the lowest possible aggression rating of 1. Once the AI changed its government form to democracy, its aggression level decreased by 2 leading to an aggression level of −1.
    The aggression level was stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer and the negative value would therefore result in an integer overflow, with the value being stored as 255 and X supposedly becoming about 25 times more aggressive than the most aggressive leaders in the game giving X a tendency to use nuclear weapons.
    What was the nickname given to this legend?
