<section><section><h4>Question 1</h4><p class="r-fit-text">-Eustachius Benedictus de Lannoy was a skilled military strategist and commander who originally worked for the Dutch navy. After being taken as a prisoner of war by the army of the Kingdom of X, he decided to take up the offer of the King to serve in the local army which he did for 37 years. This was the first time in modern history that an Asian power had managed to defeat a major European force. His help would later help expand the kingdom and modernise the army.The inscriptions on his tomb at the De Lannoy Fort can be seen in the image below.Identify this kingdom.#1

<section><section><h4>Question 3</h4><p class="r-fit-text">-The Indian Express describes X as a place that once thrived on agriculture and later moved on to industries due to modernisation. Another reason they state for the decline of farming in the area is the effluents from the factories polluting the water. Before people inhabited the area, it was all hills and forests. During winter, one could see mist covering the hilltops. In 2006, the person (receiving the award) in the photo, Y did something here to save his friend, the memory of which has been renewed in our minds by a piece of popular media. Where is X?#1
