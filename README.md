Hello there! If you are reading this, it means you are a member of Enquesta! (Or you got access to this file :P )
================================================================================================

For non-coders, all you have to know is 5-6 files: (Currently 4) The questions.txt, answers.txt, main.py and main1.html

First clone a reveal.js demo repo.

In questions.txt, you enter each question in a separate line.
In answers.txt, you enter each answer in a separate line(Preferably with numbering).

Then, you run the different scripts to get required html files.

After all this, you double-click the main1.html file. Voila! The web-page opens!

If you want to add stuff like text formatting, background formatting, etc., just contact the Enquesta Web-Dev Team.
